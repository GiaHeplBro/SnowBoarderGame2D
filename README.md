#  Snowboarding Unity Game ( Deployment and Technical Overview )

## **1. Deployment Process of this 2D Unity Game**

I followed the tutorial "Create a 2D Snow Boarder Game with Unity and" from SK Courses Lab to deploy my Snowboarding 2D Unity game. There are multiple platforms available for deployment, but I chose itch.io as my primary platform. Once deployed, I received a direct itch.io link to share with others so they can try out the game.

This is the game Menu and UI. It includes one of the levels.

And this is when the player crashes.

### **Disclaimer:**
This 2D Unity game is currently designed for **PC and laptop** only, as it relies on keyboard input for movement. It does not support touchscreen controls yet, but I plan to add mobile support in future updates.

# **Snowboarding 2D Unity Game Development Report**

## **1. Game Idea**
The design of this 2D snowboarding game is inspired by classic **endless runners** and **extreme sports games** like **SSX Tricky** and **Altoâ€™s Adventure**. The focus is on smooth movement, physics-based gameplay, and performing tricks while navigating an icy terrain.

### **Inspirations for the Game:**
#### **Extreme Snowboarding Games:**
- Smooth controls and responsive physics-based movement.
- Trick-based mechanics for extra points.
- Obstacle-based progression (trees, rocks, gaps).

#### **Casual Arcade Games:**
- Simple controls with increasing difficulty.
- Endless and level-based modes.
- High-score tracking for replayability.

## **2. Game Features**

Core Mechanics:

Jumping & Movement: The player can jump and move left or right while in the air.

Scoring System: Points are earned based on successful tricks and reaching checkpoints.

Obstacles & Environment:

Foggy Areas: Reduce visibility, adding difficulty.

Ice Patches: Cause the player to slide further.

Aerial Hazards: Birds may appear and interfere with movement.

Endless Run: The game consists of a single level, but the challenge is to earn as many points as possible before reaching the goal.

Planned Features (Future Updates):

Star Collection: Players can collect stars for additional points.

Advanced Trick System:

Pressing specific keys mid-air will execute tricks.

Combining tricks into sequences will result in bonus points.

Longer Levels: Expanded terrain with more diverse challenges.

Multiple Game Modes: Different difficulty settings and challenges.

## **3. Game Development Process**

Project Setup & Tools Used:

Game Engine: Unity

Programming Language: C# (via Visual Studio)

Version Control: GitHub

Audio Assets: Free NoCopyright music

Folder Structure:

Contents of the 'Assets' Folder:

  Scripts:
  
        Contains all scripts handling movement, enemy behavior, and UI updates.
        
        Scripts were initially generated with ChatGPTâ€™s help and later refined through debugging.
        
  Sounds:
  
        Contains background music sourced from NoCopyright libraries.
        Music is set to loop.
  Scenes:
  
        Stores the Main Menu scene and Scene mission.
  Picture:
  
        Contains tag, snow, and backround picture.
  Pretabs:
  
        Contains all tab use replay.
  AssetStore:
  
        Contains backround picture from asset store.
        Some sprites were sourced from free asset websites, while others were edited in Pain2D.
  Sprites:
  
    Contains all Sprites to do.


Development Steps:

Basic Player Controls:

Implemented movement and jumping.

Physics Interactions:

Added environmental effects like sliding on ice and obstacle collisions.

UI & Score System:

Display score based on performed tricks and collected items.

Fog Mechanic:

Implemented moving fog that affects visibility.

Testing & Debugging:

Playtested controls and adjusted physics for better balance.

## **4. Deployment & Version Control**

The game is managed using GitHub for version control.

Future plans include deployment on itch.io to allow public access.

## **5. Future Plans**

Refine trick system to allow complex combinations.

Add AI-based challenges such as racing against an opponent.

Optimize performance for better gameplay experience.

Introduce leaderboard functionality to track high scores globally.

## **7. Technicalities Between Unity and GitHub**

To manage version control, I uploaded the project to GitHub. The tutorial "How to Upload Unity Projects to GitHub" by GDTitans (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YymhtHtHDb8) explains the process clearly.

### **Git Ignore in Unity**
GitHub automatically ignores unnecessary files. The `.gitignore` file for Unity excludes:
```
/Library/
/Logs/
/UserSettings/
/Temp/
/Build/
```
These folders are not needed because Unity regenerates them automatically.

### **How to Download and Open This Unity Project from GitHub**
To download and open the game in Unity, I followed the tutorial "How to import GitHub projects into Unity!" by Unity Hero (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9QK_2QW9W8).
