# Deployment and Technical Overview of Snowboarding Unity Game

## **1. Deployment Process of this 2D Unity Game**

I followed the tutorial "Unity Tutorial: How to Make a Snowboarding Game" to deploy my Snowboarding 2D Unity game. There are multiple platforms available for deployment, but I chose itch.io as my primary platform. Once deployed, I received a direct itch.io link to share with others so they can try out the game.

### **Disclaimer:**
This 2D Unity game is currently designed for **PC and laptop** only, as it relies on keyboard input for movement. It does not support touchscreen controls yet, but I plan to add mobile support in future updates.

# **Snowboarding 2D Unity Game Development Report**

## **1. Game Idea**
The design of this 2D snowboarding game is inspired by classic **endless runners** and **extreme sports games** like **SSX Tricky** and **Altoâ€™s Adventure**. The focus is on smooth movement, physics-based gameplay, and performing tricks while navigating an icy terrain.

### **Inspirations for the Game:**
#### **Extreme Snowboarding Games:**
- Smooth controls and responsive physics-based movement.
- Trick-based mechanics for extra points.
- Obstacle-based progression (trees, rocks, gaps).

#### **Casual Arcade Games:**
- Simple controls with increasing difficulty.
- Endless and level-based modes.
- High-score tracking for replayability.

## **2. Features of the Snowboarding 2D Unity Game**

This prototype **2D snowboarding game** focuses on fluid movement, obstacle avoidance, and trick performance.

### **Player Mechanics:**
- **Basic Movement:**
  - Move left and right using arrow keys or A/D keys.
  - Jump using the spacebar.
- **Physics-Based Movement:**
  - Slopes affect speed and gravity.
  - Momentum carries over through jumps and landings.
- **Tricks (Future Updates):**
  - Pressing certain keys in mid-air will execute tricks for extra points.
  - Combos allow chaining multiple tricks together.

### **Obstacle and Terrain Mechanics:**
- **Dynamic Terrain:**
  - The slope changes dynamically, with smooth inclines and declines.
  - Ice patches cause the player to slide further.
- **Obstacles:**
  - Trees, rocks, and cliffs appear randomly.
  - Crashing results in a respawn at the last checkpoint.

### **Game Objectives (in order of progression):**
1. **Navigate the snowy terrain** by dodging obstacles and maintaining momentum.
2. **Perform tricks and stunts** to maximize score.
3. **Complete level-based challenges** or survive as long as possible in endless mode.

## **3. Building Process of this 2D Unity Game**

This game is built using **Unity Engine**, with C# scripting in **Visual Studio**.

### **Project Folder Structure:**
- **Assets** (Contains sprites, sounds, scripts, and scenes.)
- **Library** (Automatically generated by Unity.)
- **Logs** (Not included in the repository.)
- **Packages** (Stores package dependencies.)
- **ProjectSettings** (Holds Unity project settings.)
- **UserSettings** (Not included in the repository.)

### **Contents of the 'Assets' Folder:**
- **C# Scripts:** Handles movement, tricks, and UI updates.
- **Audio:** Background music and sound effects.
- **Scenes:** Main game levels and menu screens.
- **Sprites:** Snowboarder, terrain elements, and obstacles.

### **Development Process Steps:**
1. **Setting Up the Project in Unity:**
   - Created a new 2D project.
   - Imported assets and structured folders.
2. **Designing the Player Character:**
   - Implemented physics-based movement.
   - Added basic jump mechanics.
3. **Creating Terrain and Obstacles:**
   - Designed procedurally generated slopes.
   - Added random obstacles.
4. **Implementing UI Elements:**
   - Designed score display, health system, and game-over screen.
5. **Adding Sound Effects and Music:**
   - Implemented background music and impact sounds.
6. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Conducted playtests and adjusted difficulty balancing.

### **Future Improvements:**
- **Introduce different snowboarding tricks.**
- **Add a competitive high-score leaderboard.**
- **Implement multiplayer support.**
- **Improve physics to make movement more realistic.**
- **Enhance UI and add visual effects for better player experience.**

## **5. Technicalities Between Unity and GitHub**

To manage version control, I uploaded the project to GitHub. The tutorial "How to Upload Unity Projects to GitHub" by GDTitans ([YouTube link]) explains the process clearly.

### **Git Ignore in Unity**
GitHub automatically ignores unnecessary files. The `.gitignore` file for Unity excludes:
```
/Library/
/Logs/
/UserSettings/
/Temp/
/Build/
```
These folders are not needed because Unity regenerates them automatically.

### **How to Download and Open This Unity Project from GitHub**
To download and open the game in Unity, I followed the tutorial "How to import GitHub projects into Unity!" by Unity Hero ([YouTube link]).
